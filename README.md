# Xinfluencer AI

A self-learning AI agent that analyzes and generates crypto content using advanced retrieval-augmented generation and continuous learning from real engagement data.

## What Makes Us Unique

**Continuous Learning from Real Engagement**: Unlike traditional AI systems that rely on static training data, Xinfluencer learns continuously from actual social media engagement metrics. Every tweet's performance feeds back into the system, creating a data flywheel that constantly improves content quality.

**Self-Reflective AI**: Our agent doesn't just generate content—it critiques and improves its own work through Self-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Before posting, the AI retrieves relevant context, drafts content, then re-retrieves and critiques its own output for accuracy and relevance.

**Multi-Signal Quality Control**: Content quality is evaluated through three independent channels: human review, AI peer review using raw GPT-4, and real Twitter engagement metrics. This triangulation ensures consistent quality while maintaining authenticity.

**Domain-Specific Expertise**: Focused specifically on cryptocurrency and Real World Assets (RWA), the system builds deep expertise through curated knowledge from trusted Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in the space.

## How It Works

### 1. Knowledge Acquisition
The system continuously monitors trusted crypto influencers, filtering content through automated quality gates that check for language, toxicity, bot activity, and engagement metrics. Only high-quality content is processed and stored in our vector database.

### 2. Intelligent Content Generation
When generating new content, the AI:
- Retrieves relevant context from our curated knowledge base
- Drafts initial content using advanced language models
- Re-retrieves supporting evidence and critiques its own work
- Iteratively improves the content before finalizing

### 3. Multi-Channel Evaluation
Every piece of content is evaluated through:
- **Human Review**: Expert oversight during early phases
- **AI Peer Review**: Automated critique using raw GPT-4
- **Engagement Metrics**: Real Twitter performance data

### 4. Continuous Improvement
Performance data feeds into our reward model, which drives:
- **Daily LoRA Updates**: Fine-tuned model adaptations
- **Weekly Policy Updates**: Reinforcement learning from human feedback
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Quality drift detection and correction
